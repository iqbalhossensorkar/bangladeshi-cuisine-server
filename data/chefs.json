        "description": "Shelly’s family moved to Britain in the 1960’s and with them they brought a genuine energy and aptitude for Bangladeshi cooking. Being encompassed by this, Shelly could ingest their abilities and overpowering eagerness for Bangladeshi nourishment. She was transfixed by the sight and aromas of the flavors put away in and around her mom’s kitchen. This, combined with her dad owning and running a Bangladeshi eatery in the 1970’s, gave her a profound comprehension of the varieties in Bangladeshi cooking. After some time Shelly figured out how to duplicate and ad lib on zest mixes and utilize cooking strategies embraced from her nation of origin, Britain. She is also known as popular name among the list of top 10 chefs in Bangladesh.",
